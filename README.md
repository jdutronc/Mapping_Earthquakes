# Mapping Earthquakes

Our assignment from the Disaster Reporting Network is to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. We will support website and mobile application development by using the latest GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survy website, traversing and retrieving the earthquake data using JavaScript and the d3 and Leaflet librairies and plotting the data on a mapbox map through an API request.
